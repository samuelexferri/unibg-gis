# Native CRS, assumed to be the same across all bands
crs: epsg:4236

# Optional GeoJSON object in the units of native CRS
# Defines a polygon such that, all valid pixels across all bands are inside this polygon
geometry:
  type: Polygon
  coordinates: [[]]

# Mapping name:str -> { shape:     Tuple[ny: int, nx: int]
#                       transform: Tuple[float x 9]}
# Captures image size, and geo-registration
grids:
  default:
    shape: [499,999]
    transform: [0.01,0.0,42,0.0,0.01,5,0.0,0.0,1.0]

# Lineage only references UUIDs of direct source datasets
# Mapping name:str -> [UUID]
lineage: {} # Set to empty object if no lineage is defined

# Per band storage information and references into `grids`
# Bands using "default" grid should not need to reference it
