# odc-product-delete (In beta)
SQL scripts to delete ODC products and related records in ODC, Explorer and OWS DB. Each script takes product_name as an input parameter.

Usage:
```
psql -v product_name=<product-to-delete> -f <scriptname.sql> -h <database-hostname> <dbname>
```

- `delete_odc_product.sql` 
    - This script will delete a product and all datasets from an ODC DB. 
    - It deletes records from tables `agdc.dataset_source`, `agdc.dataset_location`, `agdc.dataset` and `agdc.dataset_type`.
    - It also deletes indexes and view related to the ODC product.
    
- `delete_odc_product_explorer.sql` 
    - This script will delete records related to an ODC product from the Explorer Schema in the ODC DB. 
    - This script needs to be run before `delete_odc_product.sql` as script makes reference to ODC DB.
    - It deletes records from these tables `cubedash.dataset_spatial`, `cubedash.time_overview`, `cubedash.product`.
    - Also, it refreshes materialised view `cubedash.mv_dataset_spatial_quality`.

- `delete_odc_product_ows.sql`
    - This script will delete records from tables `wms.product_ranges` and `wms.sub_product_ranges`. 
    - This script needs to be run before `delete_odc_product.sql` as OWS DB maintains a foreign key to ODC DB.
    - Table `agdc.dataset_type` has foreign key constraint `wms.product_ranges_id_fkey` on table `wms.product_ranges`

### WARNING!!!
- AS ODC doesn't have product deletion feature with an intention to keep an immutable history of datasets, these scripts are created to manually delete an entire ODC Product. 
- These scripts deletes data, so review the scripts thoroughly and use it very carefully!
